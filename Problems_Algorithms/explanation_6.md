# Explantion of unsorted integer array

# Code Design

    Set one max variable to negative infinity and min variable to positive infinity, traver the list and compare with max or min variable.

# Time Complexity Analysis

    The function traverses the list exactly once, the time complexity is O(n)

# Space Complexity Analysis

    Two variable to store max and min, the space complexity is O(1)
